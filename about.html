videogames known. It is a platform where, in each edition, we will
publish works by 8 artists to contribute to their diffusion. The
fanzine's goal is to entertain and promote, while growing and including
new and diverse projects.</p>
<p>With time, we aim to become a great art directory where you can find and
discover an endless number of incredible artists who share their love
for video games.</p>
<h2>Why 8vips?</h2>
<p>8vips is a twist on the name of the 8bit video game “genre”. We wanted
to keep the sonority of the term, linking it to a new meaning. Thus, 8
Very Important PixelS refers to the importance of each bit of art that
each of the fanzine participants brings to the world of video games.</p></div></main><footer><div class="content"><div class="social"><p class="social--title">Follow us</p><ul><li><a href="https://instagram.com/8vips"><img class="social-icon" alt="Instagram icon" src="/static/images/social/instagram_icon.png"/></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/8vips"><img class="social-icon" alt="Twitter icon" src="/static/images/social/twitter_icon.png"/></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook.com/8vips"><img class="social-icon" alt="Facebook icon" src="/static/images/social/facebook_icon.png"/></a></li></ul></div><div class="info"><ul class="contact"><li><a href="/faq">FAQ</a></li><li><a href="/join">Become an artist</a></li></ul><p class="license">© 2015-2023 8vips_</p></div></div></footer></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"doc":{"body":{"raw":"8vips is a fanzine born with a mission: to make artists who love\nvideogames known.
