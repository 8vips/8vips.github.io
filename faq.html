<ul>
<li>As editors we have to like your style</li>
<li>We look for a certain diversity of styles</li>
<li>Participants must have played the game/series proposed for that issue</li>
</ul>
<h2>How is the game for each edition chosen?</h2>
<p>Some reasons that weigh on the decision:</p>
<ul>
<li>A new installment of the saga is about to come out or just came out</li>
<li>High levels of hype</li>
<li>Proposals and votes of the participants</li>
</ul>
<p>If none of the above options apply, it is most likely that there was a coup, so it will be at the discretion of the ruling editor.</p>
<h2>How can I find out what editions or activities are ongoing/planned?</h2>
<p>Very easy: follow us on social networks. From there we will announce the next topics of the fanzine and post updates.</p>
<h2>Why should you participate?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Because you like videogames and you spend all day drawing about them</li>
<li>Because it's a good way to promote yourself</li>
<li>Because you want to participate in the project and share a space with cool people</li>
<li>Because it's cool</li>
<li>Because yes</li>
</ul>
<h2>Why shouldn't you participate?</h2>
<p>Because we don’t pay. We are a non-profit fanzine, and since we do not have income by any means, we cannot share it with the artists.</p>
<p>Because sometimes we might be wrong and make mistakes. We would like to keep a community as less toxic as possible, so we warn you that despite the fact that we make an effort and will continue to make an effort so we don’t screw up, it can happen and if you are not willing to tolerate any failure, it is better to avoid potential disappointment.</p>
<h2>I've read all of the above and I'm still interested. How do I participate?</h2>
<p>You can contact the organizers through <a href="/join">I want to be an artist</a> . There you can find all the info that must be included with your application, which is basically you Portfolio (any website or social network where we can see your art).</p>
<p>Additionally, we would appreciate it if you tell us about any games you would like to represent with your art/any ideas.</p></div></main><footer><div class="content"><div class="social"><p class="social--title">Follow us</p><ul><li><a href="https://instagram.com/8vips"><img class="social-icon" alt="Instagram icon" src="/static/images/social/instagram_icon.png"/></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/8vips"><img class="social-icon" alt="Twitter icon" src="/static/images/social/twitter_icon.png"/></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook.com/8vips"><img class="social-icon" alt="Facebook icon" src="/static/images/social/facebook_icon.png"/></a></li></ul></div><div class="info"><ul class="contact"><li><a href="/faq">FAQ</a></li><li><a href="/join">Become an artist</a></li></ul><p class="license">© 2015-2023 8vips_</p></div></div></footer></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"doc":{"body":{"raw":"## How are the participants selected?\n\n- As editors we have to like your style\n- We look for a certain diversity of styles\n- Participants must have played the game/series proposed for that issue\n\n## How is the game for each edition chosen?\n\nSome reasons that weigh on the decision:\n\n- A new installment of the saga is about to come out or just came out\n- High levels of hype\n- Proposals and votes of the participants\n\nIf none of the above options apply, it is most likely that there was a coup, so it will be at the discretion of the ruling editor.\n\n## How can I find out what editions or activities are ongoing/planned?\n\nVery easy: follow us on social networks.
